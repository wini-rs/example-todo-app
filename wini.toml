# The cache rules for the cache categories.
# > Note that each cache category (html, css, javscripts, public, or more if defined in
# `./src/shared/wini/cache.rs`), should have a cache rule associated to it in all environments.
#
# cache.default: Will be applied to every environment. (`./src/shared/wini/env.rs`)
# cache.xxxxxxx: (with *xxxxxxx* being a type of environment) Will overwrite cache.default if 
# the server is running under that environment.
# cache.xxxxxxx.function: Should function marked as "#[cache]", be cached ?
